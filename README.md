# Facebook Login Request Reversal

Login to non-2fa Facebook accounts via HTTP requests completely undetected. Recieves all cookies required to make requests to any of Facebook's private api's endpoints.

# Patched

Facebook patched my method, I've already reversed their new endpoint, message me on Telegram for info - Will not opensource, sense Facebook is clearly watching. (They updated just enough to patch my method, everything else is the same)

# Reversing Other Facebook Endpoints

I've reversed all GraphQL endpoints on Facebook's private API, contact me for more info.
